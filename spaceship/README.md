Space ship project, where there is a space ship located on the axis x and y, at coordination [0,0] lookling up towards (y+). the aim of this program is to take char string as an input, and move the space ship accordingly the string has 'A' for advance, 'L' for turning left and 'R' for turning right. at the end, the coords and direction of the ship should be handed in as a formatted string.

***Steps***
1. Create main for testing and string command input.
2. Create the my_spaceship function
    a. create and malloc the varialbles needed (coords, end string, index).
    b. loop inside the input to determin the which function to call (advance function , or advance function) depending on the command string.
3. Create the advance function
4. Create the turn function
5. test using "RRAALLAA" a. is [0,0] U, "RAALLARRALA" a. is [2,1] U, "RAAALARRAAAALLLAARALALALALALLLAAA" a. is [4,-2] R.
